# Flow transition contracts

This directory contains the public Stage 0 contracts and read-only transition
interfaces for the harness-neutral `flow` replacement. It does not implement
the replacement runtime or authorize replacement launches.

The managed sources under `config/flow/` are:

- `contracts/catalog.v1.json` - public contract names, the five
  `FlowRuntime` operations, authority ownership, and the initial no-import
  decision.
- `launch-policy.v1.json` - the converged selector policy. Its default is
  `legacy-claude/v1`; `flow-runtime/v1` is disabled.
- `legacy-baselines.v1.json` - content-addressed Git trees for both frozen
  legacy implementations and their permitted change policy.
- `transition-ledger.v1.json` - release, environment, evidence digests,
  statuses, defects, exceptions, decisions, and timestamps.

Each ledger binds one release to one exact target environment. Evidence for a
different host class or transition stage belongs in a distinct ledger rather
than being aggregated into an environment-neutral pass.

Convergence links the complete directory to `~/.config/flow`. Applying
convergence repeatedly therefore reapplies the same declared selector instead
of deriving authority from which implementations happen to be installed.

Inspect the authority-derived projection from a repository checkout with:

```sh
npm --silent --prefix tools/flow run status
```

The JSON result includes the exact ledger and policy watermarks, selected
implementation, evidence status counts, defects, exceptions, decision, and
closed legal next actions. Querying is read-only. A digest mismatch,
inconsistent authority root, unknown contract, or evidence path outside the
managed transition root fails closed.

Run the deterministic contract and projection suite with:

```sh
npm --prefix tools/flow test
```
