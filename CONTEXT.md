# Dotfiles convergence

This repository describes and converges a personal development environment on
supported hosts while preserving machine-local identity, secrets, and state.

## Language

**Convergence**:
Applying the repository until every managed resource matches its declared state.
_Avoid_: Setup, provisioning

**Host**:
A supported macOS workstation or Ubuntu server receiving the managed environment.
_Avoid_: Machine, target

**Managed resource**:
A tool, package, repository, preference, configuration link, or cache whose desired state is declared here.
_Avoid_: Dotfile when referring to non-file state

**Machine-local configuration**:
Host-specific identity, paths, aliases, and secrets stored outside the repository.
_Avoid_: Private dotfiles, overrides

**Migration**:
An ordered, idempotent transition from a previously managed layout to the current one.
_Avoid_: Bootstrap step, cleanup

**Bootstrap lifecycle**:
The ordered phases that validate a host, apply managed resources, run migrations, and warm derived state.
_Avoid_: Install script

**Recorder**:
The optional macOS recording and transcription environment managed separately from the default convergence path.
_Avoid_: Recording stack

## Relationships

- **Convergence** applies **managed resources** to exactly one **host**.
- A **host** owns exactly one set of **machine-local configuration**.
- The **bootstrap lifecycle** runs pending **migrations** before warming derived state.
- The **recorder** extends **convergence** only when explicitly enabled.

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "Should this Git identity be another managed resource?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Identity is machine-local configuration; convergence creates its file but never supplies its value."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "Bootstrap" previously referred both to the full lifecycle and individual
  helper scripts; use **bootstrap lifecycle** for the whole operation and name
  individual phases by their responsibility.
